# Sliding Window

This pattern involves creating a window which can be either an array or number from one position to another

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or decreases (and a new window is created)

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

```JavaScript
/*
  Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array
*/

```
